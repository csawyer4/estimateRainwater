									<h2>Environmentally</h2>
									<p>Green infrastructure(GI) is an alternative way of dealing with storm water that can help reduce flooding. GI is an urban stormwater management practice that relies on the natural water cycle to clean water. Instead of using flood defenses like levees that restrain the riverâ€™s movement, we can implement GI to help create a more permeable environment to prevent flooding from happening in the first place. With flood defenses, the goal is to keep floodwaters from developments, but with GI, the goal is to reduce the amount of floodwater. The former alone cannot prevent flooding but the latter is getting at the heart of the problem. Studies have found that RWCSs can greatly reduce flood volumes and water demand. By collecting rainwater from household roofs there is less water on the ground during heavy rain events meaning there will be less surface runoff. This results in less water carrying chemicals and pollutants into rivers and water bodies. Along with this, less urban flooding could help reduce the stress on stormwater drains that leads to the occurrence of combined sewage overflows. By using the rainwater to water the lawn at a later date when it is not raining outside the plants and the ground have a better chance of absorbing the water. This way the water follows a normal water cycle as if it had not been manipulated by man. It is important to get the community involved in environmental projects for their own health and also to supplement what is already being done in the county by different companies and government agencies. By working together, we can solve this issue that we have created before it is too late. </p>

									<h2>Personally</h2>
									<p>The public can be empowered by having a hands-on approach to dealing with serious problems like urban flooding. Being involved in environmental conservation can make not only the environment healthier but individuals as well, including feeling like you belong and are safe in your community. Being connected to something greater than oneself and knowing you are making a difference can give you a purpose and a path. With mental health and environmental health being very important issues, it is good to know that you can work on both at the same time, especially with your busy schedule. Let us not forget that colelcting rainwater is using free resources and that means you are saving money on water. Go check out the estimating tool today to see how much you could save in a year by implementing a rainwater catchment system. Doesn't saving make us all feel better? </p>
